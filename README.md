Find the solution to the quadratic equation axx + bx + c = 0  
Enter the values for a, b, and c in order.  
a = 2  
b = 5  
c = -3  
There are two solutions for x.  
x1 = 2  
x2 = -12  

Find the solution to the quadratic equation a(x-p)(x-p) + q = 0  
Enter the values for a, p, and q in order.  
a = 2  
p = 3  
q = 4  
It cannot be obtained because the solution is imaginary.
